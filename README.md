# 👋 Hi, I'm Laura

🎓 **PhD Researcher | Chemistry, Machine Learning, Value Chain Optimisation | Imperial College London**

I'm a first-year PhD student at **Imperial College London**, working within the **Centre for Doctoral Training in Green Industrial Futures (CDT-GIF)** and **BASF**. My research focuses on the intersection of **machine learning, sustainable chemistry, and supply chain optimisation**, aiming to develop data-driven systems that reduce the carbon footprint of chemical value chains.

I hold an **MSci in Chemistry** from Imperial College London, where I explored applications of large language models in text mining chemical literature. Along the way, I've worked on chemical database development, web development, and Google Cloud Run projects.
